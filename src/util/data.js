They only sell items in these categories (Antiques, Vintage Cars, Furniture, Art, and Electronics). They have 2 types of clients, sellers, specific clients that have items for sale and buyers, interested clients that are looking to acquire certain items. They host in-house auctions for these items on a specific date and at a specific time, they have about 3 rooms with similar items, in the same group and each interested client (buyer) can only be in a room at a time and must be present for the bidding period. Their buyers operate based on anonymity and the bidding only lasts for 2 hours. At the end of each bidding period, most of the items would have potential buyers and both the buyer and the seller, goes home happy. Auctioneer needs a developer that can simulate their auction process on an online platform. A single page web application has been developed, called “bidwars”, this web application simulates the behaviour described above and delivers value to both interested buyers and sellers. ",
